To start the project, run npm run dev. A MockApi has been set up with an endpoint, and six todo objects have been created. Data retrieval from the todos collection was implemented using the GET method on the REST API (to fulfill Front-End Requirement 7). Additionally, data can be added to the todos collection using the POST method (Front-End Requirement 8). The DELETE method allows for removing data from the todos collection (Front-End Requirement 9), and the PUT method enables updating data in the todos collection (Front-End Requirement 10).

Front-End Requirements:
The project is built with the latest version of React, following the recommended practices of Next.js 14.
JavaScript is used for coding within the React.js framework.
The 'Formik' library is utilized for handling forms (such as adding and editing tasks).
There is a listing page for the todo items.
An interface is provided for adding new todo items.
Todo items can be deleted from the list.
Completed todo items can be marked as 'done.'
The 'Axios' library is employed for making endpoint requests.
